# Auth0 iOS Samples

This repository contains all iOS samples for the following categories

* Classic: Default authentication using database, social or enterprise connection.
* Passwordless: Authentication using passwordless connection (email, sms or TouchID)

And each categories has a sample using [Lock for iOS](https://github.com/auth0/lock.ios-osx) or a completely custom UI using Auth0 authentication API directly, all of them written in Objective-C and Swift.
